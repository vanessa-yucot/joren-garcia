            <h1>Some Kind of Marriage</h1>
            <p>
                Meet Daeun Yoo--an independent woman building her career in fashion... until she's transferred to personally assist Joowon Han--a young CEO of a successful fashion business. Throw the gutsy assistant and her egotistic, moody boss in a birthday party, and voil√†--a disastrous collision of a two-tier cake smushed between them on the floor for the entire company to see, no less! She anxiously awaits her punishment, but much to her surprise, Joowon proposes marriage to her. Is this a new form of punishment? Just as Daeun decides to reject her insufferable boss, he makes an offer no sane person can refuse. But is there a catch?
